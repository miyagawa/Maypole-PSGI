NAME
    Maypole::PSGI - Runs Maypole application as PSGI application

SYNOPSIS
      # in app.psgi
      use BeerDB;
      use Maypole::PSGI;

      my $handler = sub { Maypole::PSGI->run('BeerDB', @_) };

DESCRIPTION
    Maypole::PSGI is an Maypole adapter to run Maypole application on any
    PSGI server. It uses CGI::PSGI and then wrap CGI::Maypole and does some
    really wacky hack to adapt Maypole's hardcoded dispatcher list, but it
    works :)
